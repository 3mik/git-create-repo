    <h1>Whiskey In The Jar</h1>
    <h2>Metallica</h2>
    <br>
    <p>As I was going over <br>
       The Cork and Kerry Mountains <br>
        I saw Captain Farrell <br>
        And his money he was countin' <br>
        I first produced my pistol <br>
        And then produced my rapier <br>
        I said "Stand and deliver <br>
        Or the devil he may take ya" </p>
